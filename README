C Test Functions aims to provide an easy and simple way of testing C projects.
The unit tests are included directly in the files next to the tested behavior.
The tests are run by the `ctf` program on the compiled executable.

USAGE
=====

To write a test, include the `libctf.h` header in the `lib` directory. Now write
a test:

CTF_TEST(test_name,
	printf("testing...");
	assert(1 + 1 == 3);
)

This will only exist when the symbol CTF_TESTS_ENABLED is defined. If so, a
static function with the name `test_name` is created, so you can't reuse the
name. The executable `ctf` depends on test symbols in your program existing in
the compiled version, so make sure symbols are exported by default in whatever
way possible.

Now run the tests:

 $ ctf <your executable>
-- test_name --
test_name:testing...
test_name:Assertion failed: (1 + 1 == 3), function test_name, file test.c, line 3.
test_name FAILED   Exit code: 0   Core dumped

For further information, consult the help information with `ctf -h`.
